# Video IDs

YouTube's [3DES encryption key](/t/incremental_ids) was changed at some point in 2006 as *YouTube concluded that too many people had access to the encryption secret*. As a result, older video archives in the format of `index.php?v=` use the old ID. However, the older ID links still returned the video page for some time.

As an example, [JRNZJ2_fO7Q](https://web.archive.org/web/20070125054047/youtube.com/index.php?v=JRNZJ2_fO7Q) shows the video "**Crushing my camera**" with the URL `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwIToyFs2Lc`

[jwIToyFs2Lc](/videos#35) is the post-2006 ID.

TubeVault relies on the post-2006 IDs for placements and there's currently no way to reverse these pre-2006 IDs. As a result, we have been unable to find the placement for certain known videos.

Noteable examples include:
1. "**Welcome to YouTube**" by TheDog. The page source of [this archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20050429024525/http://www.youtube.com/) shows the old ID `h_aLD8jMc7k`. However, there are no known archives* of the video with the new ID.
2. [This blog post](https://jones4carrie.livejournal.com/86102.html?noscroll#comments) by [Jones4Carrie](/users#39) links 2 pre-2006 IDs. It's suspected that one of them is for a now-deleted video (2iTQnumR6Is), however this cannot be definitively proven.

*It's claimed that [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EVPZj7K7HE) shows a playlist with the "**Welcome To YouTube!**" video. However, the post-2006 video ID is unknown.

The oldest videos are currently tracked here:
