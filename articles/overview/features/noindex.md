# noindex

There are **less than 10 channels on YouTube** with this feature. This is the only known public censorship flag. As the name would imply, this feature prevents a channel from being indexed on YouTube. One of the few known channels with this feature is [Race & Reason](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-8U_MhAZnBXKZvI5kMllLA).

When viewing the page source of the channel:

```js
"noindex":true,"unlisted":false,"familySafe":true
```

You can see the flag `noindex` which is enabled.

## Tommy Robinson

The channel "[**Tommy Robison Online**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6wdP5hTf_phre6Q3kFiV2g)" used to have this feature enabled. It was removed from the channel after [backlash from Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1874643357622059227). 

The noindex feature being enabled can be seen in the page soure of [this archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20240127064857/https://m.youtube.com/channel/UC6wdP5hTf_phre6Q3kFiV2g).

Previously, on every video from channels with this feature, a warning would be displayed:

This has since been removed for all channels with this feature.
