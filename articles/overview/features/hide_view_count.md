# Hide View Count

This is an extremely rare feature that is enabled via CMS to internal YouTube-owned channels. In the past, this feature was widely available but was since removed. Videos that previously had view counts hidden remain hidden. All known channels with this feature are tied to a YouTube internal CMS.
