# Recommend Itself

This is an extremely rare feature that is only enabled for certain Enterprise/Government YouTube channels. It restricts all recommendations for a channels videos to be from that channel itself. It's suspected that this feature was released to prevent porn being displayed in a channel's video recommendations to appeal to advertisers, which was a big problem in 2008.

This feature does not work on YouTube shorts.
