She played the \"straight man\" in many of my short films, and she loved belly rubs.  \nOn April 1st, 2014, she passed away from liver and spleen tumors, and we buried her in the ground in the middle of a rainstorm.  This is my celebration of her life... \n\nPlease save a life and adopt your next best friend.  \nSupport \"A Purposeful Rescue,\" an amazing organization in Los Angeles that saves dogs from high-kill shelters and helps find them their new forever homes.\nhttp://www.apurposefulrescue.org/\n\nSpecial thanks to Jade Dornfeld for cinematography.

As the actual candidates drop out of \r\nthe race one by one, their characters will face their demise at the hands of their rivals. \r\nLet's give Americans what they truly want from their electoral process: a good fight!",

This isn't my 100 subscriber special video, but just something to say a quick \"thank you\" with.\n\nIt's been a while since I've edited any videos, so it took me quite a long time to figure out how to cut things out properly with new editing software. Once I got that figured out, I had a ton of encoding issues with the video. So irritating! I've finally figured it all out now, so future uploads should be much quicker to come out. Anyhow, if you notice some cuts throughout the video, I cut out the parts of the recording that showed me saving my progress.\n\nPoyo!",

Once the design files are created they are put into the laser cutting software, from there the wood is laser cut and engraved with D20 imagery. The woods edges are then painted and everything gets sanded and finished. Then it is time to put everything together. CA Glue is used for a strong and sturdy hold and the leatherette corners are glued into place! The tray is done and ready for Tabletop Game Night! Created by WizardFire in California.

SUBSCRIBE: youtube.com/c/COBALTGRUV. Drop a Super Thanks or hit buymeacoffee.com/COBALTGRUV—no pressure, a buck keeps this vibe alive. Rock on! 🤘🏻\n\nI didn’t just let AI run this. Used it as a tool—started with original lyrics, flipped ‘em, tweaked through 30 tries. Added record scratches, gun cocks via prompts, mixed it in GarageBand, spiced it up, then captioned it in CapCut. Hard work, not a handout—hope you feel it!\n\n(Intro)Yo, it’s Christmas on the block tonight,Reindeers rollin’, Santa’s ridin’—no place to hide.Grandma’s caught slippin’, it’s about to go down,Turn the sleigh up loud, welcome to our town.\n\n(Verse 1)Grandma got caught up by a reindeer,Late night creepin’, she was headin’ outta here.We told her, “Yo, chill, don’t hit the street.”But she said, “Nah, I’m good,” and grabbed her feet.\n\nShe was sippin’ eggnog, straight out the cup,Mixin’ it with meds, now she actin’ all tough.Snow was fallin’, but she didn’t even care,Next thing you know, antlers in the air.\n\n(Chorus)Grandma got caught up by a reindeer,Cruisin’ past our block on Christmas Eve, yeah.You can say Santa’s fake, it’s just a myth,But me and Grandpa, we don’t play with this.\n\n(Verse 2)Now the streets talk, and the hood’s on fire,Santa left the scene, sleigh tires spinnin’ higher.Hoof prints on her face, Claus marks on her back,This ain’t no accident—it’s a straight-up attack.\n\nGrandpa’s posted up, drink in his hand,Playin’ spades with Belle, like a real OG man.But deep down, he’s got a tear in his eye,‘Cause Christmas without Grandma don’t fly.\n\n(Bridge)We dressed in black, the fam lookin’ mean,Silent night turnin’ into a crime scene.Open up her gifts? Nah, better hold back,Santa’s got beef, and we’re ready to clap.\n\n(Chorus)Grandma got caught up by a reindeer,Cruisin’ past our block on Christmas Eve, yeah.You can say Santa’s fake, it’s just a myth,But me and Grandpa, we don’t play with this.\n\n(Verse 3)Goose on the table, pudding on lock,Blue and silver candle, Grandma’s wig on top.We light it up for her, but let me tell you this,Santa’s rollin’ dirty, rollin’ with a twist.\n\nWarned the neighbors, “Stay strapped, don’t slip,”If you see a sleigh comin’, better dip quick.Santa got a license? Man, who gave him that?Rollin’ with the elves like a straight-up pack.\n\n(Outro)Grandma got caught up by a reindeer,Cruisin’ past our block on Christmas Eve, yeah.Me and Grandpa, yeah, we believe,Gonna keep her memory alive on Christmas Eve.\n\nSo next time you see Santa ridin’ that sleigh,Tell him, “Don’t mess around, we’re comin’ your way!”\n\n#COBALTGRUV #GangstaRapRemix #ChristmasRap #YouTubeOG #Nostalgia",

Join me as I breathe new life into a yacht on the brink of oblivion, tackling challenges, mastering the art of wrenching, and reaping the rewards.

Thank you for your support!\n\nHow Do I Choose the Right Boat for Me?\n\nChoosing the right boat involves several key considerations to ensure that the vessel you select meets your needs and preferences. Here’s a comprehensive guide to help you make an informed decision:\n\n1. Identify Your Purpose\n\n • Recreational Boating: If your primary goal is leisure and entertainment, consider boats designed for activities like cruising, water sports, or day trips.\n • Fishing: If you’re an angler, look for fishing boats equipped with rod holders, live wells, and ample storage for gear.\n • Sailing: If you enjoy the art of sailing, a sailboat might be the right choice, offering a range of options from small dinghies to larger yachts.\n • Long-Distance Travel: For extended trips and liveaboard experiences, consider cabin cruisers or trawlers with living accommodations.\n\n2. Determine the Size\n\n • Small Boats (Under 20 Feet): Ideal for day trips, fishing, and water sports. They are easier to trailer and store.\n • Medium Boats (20-40 Feet): Suitable for longer outings and can offer more amenities, such as cabins and bathrooms.\n • Large Boats (Over 40 Feet): Designed for extended voyages and liveaboard options. They provide the most comfort and space but require more maintenance and larger docking facilities.\n\n3. Consider Your Budget\n\n • Initial Cost: Boats vary widely in price based on size, type, and features. Set a budget that includes the purchase price and additional costs.\n • Maintenance and Upkeep: Factor in ongoing costs for maintenance, storage, fuel, insurance, and registration.\n • Depreciation: Understand that boats depreciate over time, so consider the resale value.\n\n4. Choose the Right Type\n\n • Powerboats: These include runabouts, pontoon boats, and cabin cruisers. They are powered by engines and are great for speed and water sports.\n • Sailboats: Rely on wind power and offer a traditional boating experience. They range from small sailboats to large sailing yachts.\n • Fishing Boats: Designed for anglers with features like casting decks and fish finders. Types include bass boats, center consoles, and sport fishing boats.\n • Personal Watercraft (PWC): Jet skis and similar small watercraft for fun and thrill rides.\n\n5. Evaluate Features and Amenities\n\n • Comfort Features: Look for seating capacity, shade (bimini tops), and onboard facilities like bathrooms (heads) and kitchens (galleys).\n • Technology and Electronics: Consider navigation systems, fish finders, and entertainment systems.\n • Storage and Space: Ensure there is enough storage for gear, supplies, and personal items.\n\n6. Consider Usage and Environment\n\n • Water Type: Consider whether you’ll be boating in freshwater or saltwater. Saltwater boats require more corrosion-resistant materials.\n • Local Conditions: Think about the typical weather and water conditions where you’ll be boating. Some boats handle rough waters better than others.\n • Frequency of Use: How often you plan to use the boat can influence the type and amount of investment you want to make.\n\n7. Test Drive and Inspection\n\n • Sea Trial: Always take a potential boat for a sea trial to see how it handles and performs on the water.\n • Professional Inspection: Have the boat inspected by a marine surveyor to identify any potential issues or necessary repairs.\n\n8. Regulations and Licensing\n\n • Boating License: Check local regulations to see if you need a boating license and what the requirements are.\n • Safety Regulations: Ensure the boat meets all safety standards and is equipped with the necessary safety gear.\n\n9. Resale and Depreciation\n\n • Brand Reputation: Some brands hold their value better than others. Research the reputation and resale value of the boat brands you’re considering.\n • Market Trends: Stay informed about market trends to understand the best times to buy or sell a boat.\n\n10. Community and Support\n\n • Local Clubs and Groups: Joining a boating club or group can provide support, advice, and a sense of community.\n • Dealer and Manufacturer Support: Choose reputable dealers and manufacturers who offer good customer support and service.\n\nBy carefully considering these factors, you can choose the right boat that fits your lifestyle, needs, and budget, ensuring many enjoyable and safe boating experiences.",

        "title": "Sea otter cares for its young pup!",
        "description": "### How Do Sea Otters Care for Their Young?\n\nSea otters are known for their nurturing behavior and strong maternal instincts. Here's a comprehensive look at how sea otters care for their young:\n\n#### 1. **Birth and Early Days**\n- **Birth**: Sea otters give birth in the water, typically to a single pup, although twins are possible but rare. Pups are born year-round but peak birthing periods vary by location.\n- **Initial Care**: Immediately after birth, the mother begins to groom the pup. This grooming is crucial as it helps fluff up the pup’s fur, which is essential for buoyancy and insulation.\n\n#### 2. **Grooming and Fluffing**\n- **Constant Grooming**: Sea otter pups rely heavily on their fur for warmth and buoyancy since they are born without a thick layer of blubber. Mothers spend a significant amount of time grooming their pups to keep their fur clean, fluffed, and waterproof.\n- **Floating Ability**: The grooming ensures the fur traps air, making the pup buoyant and able to float on the surface of the water.\n\n#### 3. **Feeding and Nursing**\n- **Nursing**: Pups nurse frequently on their mother's rich milk, which is high in fat to promote rapid growth. Nursing can continue for up to six months, although pups start to eat solid food after the first few weeks.\n- **Introduction to Solid Food**: As pups grow, mothers begin to introduce them to solid food, teaching them how to hunt and forage.\n\n#### 4. **Learning to Swim and Hunt**\n- **Swimming Lessons**: Mothers give swimming lessons to their pups, initially carrying them on their bellies or backs while swimming. Gradually, the pups learn to paddle and swim on their own.\n- **Hunting Skills**: Mothers also teach their pups how to dive and catch prey, such as shellfish, sea urchins, and small fish. These skills are crucial for the pup’s survival once it becomes independent.\n\n#### 5. **Protection and Safety**\n- **Vigilance**: Mothers are very protective and vigilant, keeping a close eye on their pups to protect them from predators such as sharks and eagles.\n- **Holding Hands**: Sea otters often hold hands while resting or sleeping to prevent drifting apart, a behavior known as \"rafting.\" This not only keeps them together but also provides safety in numbers.\n\n#### 6. **Social Behavior and Play**\n- **Play**: Play is an important part of a sea otter pup’s development. It helps them practice hunting techniques, build strength, and develop social skills.\n- **Social Structure**: Pups often interact with other otters, learning important social behaviors and norms within their groups.\n\n#### 7. **Independence**\n- **Weaning**: As the pups grow and become more skilled at swimming and hunting, the mother gradually weans them off her milk.\n- **Independence**: Around six months old, the pups become more independent, though some may stay with their mother for longer periods, learning and honing their survival skills.\n\n#### 8. **Challenges and Adaptation**\n- **Environmental Challenges**: Mothers and pups must adapt to environmental challenges such as changes in food availability and habitat conditions.\n- **Human Impact**: Human activities such as oil spills and fishing can impact sea otter populations. Conservation efforts are in place to protect sea otters and their habitats, ensuring they have safe environments to raise their young.\n\nBy meticulously grooming, feeding, teaching, and protecting their young, sea otter mothers ensure their pups are well-prepared for independent life in the wild. This intricate care system is vital for the survival and growth of sea otter populations.",

We were just sending it off rooftops for the fun of it.\nFlip hits at 0:20 if you're skipping around.\n\nI don’t live there anymore, and I’m not flipping every day like I used to...\nbut the legacy still means something.\n\nOver the past 19+ years, this channel's become a mix of old-school flips, truck builds, fishing missions, dogs, and whatever else life threw my way.\nBoating came later — and who knows if it sticks — but the camera’s always rolling.\n\n🙌 If you’ve been here since the early days, or just found this through Jawed’s playlist:\nThank you.\nYou helped make this video a part of YouTube history.\n\n⚙️ Want to keep it going?\n✅ Subscribe to help push this channel to the next milestone\n💬 Comment below — I read ’em, and I pin the good ones\n🛟 Join the channel for early drops & member perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs0ACZIa1m4ecu2zijr-8Sg/join\n☕ Buy me a coffee to help keep the content flowing:\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/COBALTGRUV\n\n🤸‍♂️ Thinking of learning a backflip?\nStart with strength: squats, planks, push-ups\nStretch your back & hammies\nUse a trampoline or foam pit if possible\nJump high, tuck tight, spot the landing\nGo slow. Stay safe. Then send it.\n\n#COBALTGRUV #FirstBackflip #YouTubeOG #BackflipLegacy #User42 #ThrowbackFlip #FlipsFishingTrucks",

In this \"amnesia run,\" I'm playing the new real-time, fully-3D remake, released on June 25, 2024. This version features stunning updated graphics, improved controls, enhanced puzzles, and VR support.\n\nContinuing the story from 1993's \"Myst,\" I once again control \"the Stranger,\" who must assist Atrus, an artisan and explorer, in rescuing his wife Catherine from the clutches of Gehn, Atrus's manipulative father and ruler of Riven: a beautiful world of interconnected islands. To save Catherine and return safely, I'll need to unravel the intricate mysteries of Riven, learn about its inhabitants, and confront the power-hungry Gehn. Who's telling the truth? What does that switch do? How do I open this door? Join me on this let's play to uncover all the answers!\n\nOriginally released by Cyan on October 31, 1997, \"Riven\" garnered critical acclaim and became the best-selling game of the year. Unlike its predecessor, this follow-up offers a more directionless approach to its puzzles and storytelling, but rewards with its expansive world building, deep lore, and gorgeous design.

This version features stunning updated graphics, improved controls, enhanced puzzles, and VR support.\n\nContinuing the story from 1993's \"Myst,\" I once again control \"the Stranger,\" who must assist Atrus, an artisan and explorer, in rescuing his wife Catherine from the clutches of Gehn, Atrus's manipulative father and ruler of Riven: a beautiful world of interconnected islands. To save Catherine and return safely, I'll need to unravel the intricate mysteries of Riven, learn about its inhabitants, and confront the power-hungry Gehn. Who's telling the truth?

In this \"amnesia run,\" I'm playing the new real-time, fully-3D remake, released on June 25, 2024. This version features stunning updated graphics, improved controls, enhanced puzzles, and VR support.\n\nContinuing the story from 1993's \"Myst,\" I once again control \"the Stranger,\" who must assist Atrus, an artisan and explorer, in rescuing his wife Catherine from the clutches of Gehn, Atrus's manipulative father and ruler of Riven: a beautiful world of interconnected islands. To save Catherine and return safely, I'll need to unravel the intricate mysteries of Riven, learn about its inhabitants, and confront the power-hungry Gehn. Who's telling the truth? What does that switch do? How do I open this door? Join me on this let's play to uncover all the answers!\n\nOriginally released by Cyan on October 31, 1997, \"Riven\" garnered critical acclaim and became the best-selling game of the year. Unlike its predecessor, this follow-up offers a more directionless approach to its puzzles and storytelling, but rewards with its expansive world building, deep lore, and gorgeous design.

This version features stunning updated graphics, improved controls, enhanced puzzles, and VR support.\n\nContinuing the story from 1993's \"Myst,\" I once again control \"the Stranger,\" who must assist Atrus, an artisan and explorer, in rescuing his wife Catherine from the clutches of Gehn, Atrus's manipulative father and ruler of Riven: a beautiful world of interconnected islands.

In this \"amnesia run,\" I'm playing the new real-time, fully-3D remake, released on June 25, 2024. This version features stunning updated graphics, improved controls, enhanced puzzles, and VR support.\n\nContinuing the story from 1993's \"Myst,\" I once again control \"the Stranger,\" who must assist Atrus, an artisan and explorer, in rescuing his wife Catherine from the clutches of Gehn, Atrus's manipulative father and ruler of Riven: a beautiful world of interconnected islands. To save Catherine and return safely, I'll need to unravel the intricate mysteries of Riven, learn about its inhabitants, and confront the power-hungry Gehn. Who's telling the truth? What does that switch do? How do I open this door? Join me on this let's play to uncover all the answers!\n\nOriginally released by Cyan on October 31, 1997, \"Riven\" garnered critical acclaim and became the best-selling game of the year. Unlike its predecessor, this follow-up offers a more directionless approach to its puzzles and storytelling, but rewards with its expansive world building, deep lore, and gorgeous design.

Far more nuanced and involved than a mere \"zombie\"-style game, this Mature-rated experience blends all the best elements we play video games for: a fantastically engaging, and wonderfully voice-acted story, terrific control mechanics, inventive and clever challenges, and plenty of smiles and scares along the way. While simultaneously maintaining a bleak, yet hopeful atmosphere throughout. Where this story goes is best left unspoiled: with a number of talented characters coming in and out of the detailed, and lengthy narrative -- but our two main heroes are portrayed with a delicate level of emotion and ferocity by Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson. Their blossoming father/daughter-like relationship is the bedrock of the events on-screen, and although these are largely immoral individuals who seemingly regret nothing, they carry a huge burden, and a troubled past: making it easy to connect to their unbelievable, post-apocalyptic, yet somehow realistic situation. All of the depressing and grotesque horror is showcased alongside beautiful renderings of forgotten American neighborhoods - whether you're trekking through the flooded Red Line subway tunnel in Boston, or hiding from enemies in an abandoned ski-lodge in the dead of winter, the graphics here are a rare accomplishment, and a true sight to behold. As Johnson mentions twice in the game during pivotal moments, \"you can't deny that view\". I spent a majority of my playthrough simply admiring my scenery, and exploring the landscape, in what is easily the best-looking game for the not-quite-dead yet 7th generation of consoles. These breathtaking visuals are thankfully supported by an equally haunting and moody score from composer Gustavo Santaolalla. In the gameplay department, everything works precisely as expected, and following the occasional on-screen prompts allows for easy immersion into the control-scheme - which combines wall-piercing hearing detection, quadruple weapon holsters, conversation-initiation, crouching, running, shooting, and punching. Health is commodity, and bullets are hard to come-by, forcing a much greater appreciation for your supplies and ammo than ever before in gaming. The ability to collect materials and supplies scattered throughout the lush environments, and craft them into Molotov cocktails, health kits, or a baseball bat with knives attached to it - adds a great deal of strategy and complexity to what is a largely linear chain-of-events. Some curious decisions from your AI-allies breaks the illusion, as enemy combatants never react to their movements, and a majority of chapters are repetitive, feeling like one drawn-out stealth mission, even reusing a number of gimmicks. Otherwise, this game is near flawless, bouncing effortlessly from somber and revealing cut-scenes to terrifying shoot-outs against 7-foot-tall infected humans known as a bloaters, to sneaking past guards with shotguns in a hospital overgrown with vegetation. Winning many \"Best of show\" awards at E3 2012, this week-old game is already an obvious front-runner for game of the year - a positively thrilling, emotional, addictive, and enjoyable adventure that is impossible to put down. I finished the 15-hour single player campaign in only three evenings, and I want to jump right back into and go again, searching for the few missing artifacts and pendants I missed along the way. I honestly can't recommend this title enough. \"The Last Of Us\", A \"Strikingly engrossing story. Excellent gameplay.\"\n~",

        "description": "Jon shares some financial advice as to why credit cards are (usually) better than their debit counterparts for four main reasons: \n\n1) Credit is safer; \n2) They build your credit history;\n3) They're required for special purchases like car rentals, and\n4) they earn you points and cash-back rewards.\n\n* Obviously, this entire argument is based on the assumption that you maintain RESPONSIBLE spending habits! The high interest-rate credit cards only applies if you carry a balance month-over-month. If you pay it off before your next statement (so, at least 30 days more time than you'd get with a debit card) - you'll never 'pay extra'. Also, this discussion is mainly directed to Americans, aged 18 or older, where this advice applies most directly/accurately. \n\nAlso, anyone who doesn't agree or avoids this advice isn't actually an \"idiot\" - but it makes for a much cleaner and provocative title, so there you go (you clicked on it, didn't you?) Comments are permanently locked because no one ever bothers to read all of the above.\n\nCBS Money Watch Article -- http://cbsn.ws/NNaG2f\n10 Ways To Build Credit -- http://bit.ly/NeFKXl\nWhich Card To Get? -- http://www.creditcards.com/\n\n~~ The World According To Jon ~~\nBe informed and entertained as your host Jon showcases a recent event, story, or review and shares his opinionated and enlightened view of the world with you, by way of an unfiltered, and often brutally honest stream-of-consciousness.

After 360+ episodes, and four years of bi-weekly uploads, the program was becoming stale and repetitive, and rather than run the concept into the ground and kill its appeal, Jon AND Jory decided to retire the show while it was still popular. Although special bonus episodes may still be produced (10 have since already been posted), this shift will allow them to refocus their efforts on other projects and ideas. Plus... nearly every episode has become demonetized, making new episodes of the show extremely cost-prohibitive to create.\n\n~~ The World According To Jon ~~\nBe informed, entertained, and possibly even offended, as Jon showcases a recent event, story, or review and shares his opinionated view of the world with you, by way of an unfiltered, and often brutally honest stream-of-consciousness.
